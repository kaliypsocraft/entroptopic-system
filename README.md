# OP Information, Codes and Ciphers
- Version 1.0 28 October 2023

This project is intended to provide a suite of tools developed by _codeTradeCraft_ and _kalipysocraft_. 
The tool's intent is to provide resources for individuals studying Information Theory to validate their results.
We provide tools to solve the following:

## Codes
- Huffman r-enary Codes
- Shannon-Fano Codes
- ISBN-10 Codes
- Hamming Codes
- Comma Codes

- Arithmetic Codes
## Information
- Calcuate the information entropy of codes
- Calculate the conditional and joint entropy
- Calculate the mutual information between sources and receivers

## Number Theory
